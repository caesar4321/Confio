				"paragraphs": [
					"We aim to be Latin America's PayPal by helping Venezuelans and Argentines from hyperinflation by allowing them to pay and send in US dollar stablecoins and then expanding to the whole Latin America. We set our headline as such, because PayPal is already an established reputable service everyone knows, so it is easy for people to understand."

				"paragraphs": [
					"US Dollar stablecoin is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to one United States dollar per one coin by depositing the same worth of assets in financial instutitions. It is much easier to deliver and make the US dollar stablecoins circulate than traditional US dollars in the vulnerable economies, so we chose to take advantage of the US dolar stablecoins that are on permissionless blockchains."

					"We reviewed what factors would be the most critical to cryptocurrency mass adoption, and we concluded that, at the moment, an inflation rate would be a much more critical factor than a cryptocurrency adoption rate."

				"header": "4. Who's Behind Confío?",
				"paragraphs": [
					"Confío was started by Julian, a fresh graduate from Yonsei University in Korea back then, who always wished to change the world for a better place. He founded Duende Limited in 2019 in Seychelles and developed the Duende app from scratch as a self-taught programmer. He did everything from planning to developing the app to marketing. After that, he changed the name to Confío for rebranding to form a new team and supportive community with a fresh atmosphere."

			},
			{
				"header": "5. What Was Julian's Initiative to Start Confío?",
				"paragraphs": [
					"If you ask why Julian is interested in solving Venezuela's problem, which is far from his home country (Korea), it is because he believes, in the end, cryptocurrencies should be helpful for people. Of course, many people will make a lot of money in the process, but that's not the primary purpose he believes in. One day, the news caught his attention that Venezuela was suffering from hyperinflation, so people couldn't afford to buy food and gasoline. He thought this was a problem worth dedicating his time to and, to a more significant extent, a part of his life that should hopefully be helpful for Venezuelans."

				"header": "6. Why Did Julian Rebrand Duende to Confío?",
				"paragraphs": [
					"Julian wanted to give a fresh atmosphere to start all over Duende from the beginning with a new mindset, new plans and roadmaps, and new tokenomics. Confío means 'I trust' in Spanish."

			{
				"header": "8. Why Did Confío Not Start Over All Social Media But Inherrited All Social/Group from Duende?",
				"paragraphs": [
					"Some people advised that Julian needs to start all over from a completely new group/social, because we made a lot of mistakes in the past and there are our footprints that people can track and criticize us. However, the founder Julian personally believes that the history of our mistakes and our current moves willing to learn from the mistakes add more trust on us."

				"paragraphs": [
					"We used to have many more team members, but now except the founder Julian, who has stayed with Confío from the begining without any compensation, all other team members have left due to the lack of the funds of the project. Julian did not give up and kept persuing it, rebranding the name, as an influencer/community token/project."
