				"paragraphs": [
					"Confío was started by Julian, a fresh graduate from Yonsei University in Korea, who always wished to change the world for a better place. He founded Duende Limited in 2019 in Seychelles and developed the Duende app from scratch as a self-taught programmer. After that, he changed the name to Confío."

				"header": "5. What Was Julian's Initiative to Start Confío?",
				"paragraphs": [
					"If you ask why he is interested in solving Venezuela's problem, which is far from his home country (Korea), it is because he believes, in the end, cryptocurrencies should be helpful for people. Of course, many people will make a lot of money in the process, but that's not the primary purpose he believes in. One day, the news caught his attention that Venezuela was suffering from hyperinflation, so people couldn't afford to buy food and gasoline. He thought this was a problem worth dedicating his time to and, to a more significant extent, a part of his life that should hopefully be helpful for Venezuelans."

				"paragraphs": [
					"We used to have many more, but now except the founder Julian, who has stayed with Confío from the begining without any compensation, there are one more senior Product Designer and another senior Programmer Julian can immediately reach out to re-join the team. They have left the team due to the lack of the funds of the project."
