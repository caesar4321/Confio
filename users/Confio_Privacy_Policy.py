					"'We'(referred from Confío Terms of Service) store our users' private data on the servers located in Switzerland to protect our users' privacy to the maximum. By using the 'Confío Services'(referred from Confío Terms of Service), you are agreeing to transfer, process, and store your data in Switzerland.",
					"As well as our Terms of Service, we reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. We will inform you through the Services before the updated Privacy Policy goes into effect. If you do not agree with our updated Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using the Confío Services. You can do so at any time by deleting your Confío account.",

This Privacy Policy applies to all Confío services. The terms governing your use of the Confío Services are defined in our Terms of Service."

				"header": "1. What We Collect",
				"paragraphs": [
					"We collect basic account information you provide while signing up to the Confío Services or updating your profile. This includes email address, username, name, nationality, gender, birthday, a verification photo taken during the process of your identity verification, and a scanned copy of your national identification card or your passport.",
					"Next, we collect device and login information, as well as logs generated as a result of your activities on the Confío Services whenever you use our Services. This includes the last active time, OS, software and hardware versions, browser type and version, IP address, location, device ID, Advertising ID, your notification settings, and logs of your activities on the Confío Services.",
					"Lastly, we collect content you create and provide to or through the Confío Services. This includes the date you signed up for a Confío account, your transfer records, your payment records, your shopping records, your payroll records, your Confío application settings, reports, and feedback.",
					"Confío users may choose to open a business Confío account in addition to a personal Confío account. In that case, we will collect your business information including a scanned copy of your business registration certificate. This applies to only business Confío accounts. Not applicable to any other personal Confío accounts.",
					"Confío users under the age of 13 can only use our services under parental permission. A parental permission request is filed when the child's parent has a Confío account and the child confirms their parent's Confío username. To allow their child's usage of Confío, the parent is required to consent, and verify their children's identity and their family tie. When the parent consents and submits the verification application, the photos for verification will also be collected. If the parent does not consent or fails to consent or verify within the 7 days timeframe, we remove the all relevant information to the child from our server and if the child wishes to reinitiate the registration process, they have to start from the beginning. It is because before parental permission, we only collect the child's desired Confío username and parent's Confío username. When the parent fails to verify their children, we remove the child's desired Confío username and the information that shows their potential connection as family. After parental permission, the child is allowed to use the Confío services and we collect the same data as our adult users."

					"We use your private data to comply with AML(Anti-Money Laundering) laws and regulations and KYC(Know Your Customer) laws and regulations, and consequently, provide the Confío Services. Most of your basic account information including username, name, nationality, gender, age(automatically calculated from your birthday), will be used to prevent malicious activities taking advantage of Confío Services and better serve our users. This is to prevent misuse and fraudulence, and build a positive Confío ecosystem.",
					"We use your device and login information, and logs for statistical analysis to improve our Services and better serve our users in the future. We use report records to make a safer community. We use feedback records to improve our Services.",
					"We use a scanned copy of your national identification card or your passport to verify whether you are the right person you claimed. We use facial recognition technology to verify if your face matches the photo on your national ID card.",

					"We may use your private data to provide personalized advertisements and customer insights to business users on our services. All the private data is anonymized and our business users who use the business panel for customer insights and who wish to launch personalized advertisements cannot identify a specific user. Children under the age of13 will not be directed as a target of advertisements that may be potentially harmful for children nor do they see."

				"header": "4. When We Delete",
				"paragraphs": [
					"You can close your Confío account anytime you want unless your account has been suspended for a breach of our Terms of Service, but we do not necessarily remove the data associated with your account. At the moment, the cryptocurrency industry is facing uncertainties and ambiguousness in regards to potential regulations. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is advising to the cryptocurrency industry to introduce the \"Travel Rule\", which is about providing identity information of the originator and the beneficiary of token transfers, and there may be more to come that regulates the cryptocurrency industry as almost tight as conventional financial sectors. We believe cryptocurrencies will replace conventional fiat currencies sooner or later, and thereby, stricter regulations are inevitable. Most countries impose data store requirements to financial institutions. As such, we will hold on to removing the private data until regulations around the world become clearer about the cryptocurrency industry. When they do, we will quickly follow up with their data store requirements and privacy protection laws directly addressing cryptocurrency industries."
