				"header": "1. What We Collect",
				"paragraphs": [
					"We collect basic account information you provide while signing up to the Duende Services or updating your profile. This includes email address, username, name, nationality, gender, birthday, a verification photo taken during the process of your identity verification, and a scanned copy of your national identification card or your passport.",
					"Next, we collect device and login information, as well as logs generated as a result of your activities on the Duende Services whenever you use our Services. This includes the last active time, OS, software and hardware versions, browser type and version, IP address, location, device ID, Advertising ID, your notification settings, and logs of your activities on the Duende Services.",
					"Lastly, we collect content you create and provide to or through the Duende Services. This includes the date you signed up for a Duende account, your transfer records, your payment records, your shopping records, your payroll records, your Duende application settings, reports, and feedback.",
					"Duende users may choose to open a business Duende account in addition to a personal Duende account. In that case, we will collect your business information including a scanned copy of your business registration certificate. This applies to only business Duende accounts. Not applicable to any other personal Duende accounts.",
					"Duende users under the age of 13 can only use our services under parental permission. A parental permission request is filed when the child’s parent has a Duende account and the child confirms their parent’s Duende username. To allow their child’s usage of Duende, the parent is required to consent, and verify their children’s identity and their family tie. When the parent consents and submits the verification application, the photos for verification will also be collected. If the parent does not consent or fails to consent or verify within the 7 days timeframe, we remove the all relevant information to the child from our server and if the child wishes to reinitiate the registration process, they have to start from the beginning. It is because before parental permission, we only collect the child’s desired Duende username and parent’s Duende username. When the parent fails to verify their children, we remove the child’s desired Duende username and the information that shows their potential connection as family. After parental permission, the child is allowed to use the Duende services and we collect the same data as our adult users."

				"header": "4. When We Delete",
				"paragraphs": [
					"You can close your Duende account anytime you want unless your account has been suspended for a breach of our Terms of Service, but we do not necessarily remove the data associated with your account. At the moment, the cryptocurrency industry is facing uncertainties and ambiguousness in regards to potential regulations. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is advising to the cryptocurrency industry to introduce the “Travel Rule”, which is about providing identity information of the originator and the beneficiary of token transfers, and there may be more to come that regulates the cryptocurrency industry as almost tight as conventional financial sectors. We believe cryptocurrencies will replace conventional fiat currencies sooner or later, and thereby, stricter regulations are inevitable. Most countries impose data store requirements to financial institutions. As such, we will hold on to removing the private data until regulations around the world become clearer about the cryptocurrency industry. When they do, we will quickly follow up with their data store requirements and privacy protection laws directly addressing cryptocurrency industries."
