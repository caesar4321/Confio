					"Welcome to Duende!",
					"Duende is a cryptocurrency and e-commerce platform that enables everyone to easily use cryptocurrencies in their everyday life. Our mission is to give people the power to take control of their finance. To push forward our mission, we provide various services through websites, or software applications(together, the ‘Duende Services’ or ‘Services’)",
					"The Services are provided to you by Duende Limited, a Seychelles company. Duende Limited was organized under the laws of Seychelles, and operates under the laws of Seychelles. By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms and you are entering into a binding contract with Duende Limited. These terms govern your use of our Services. If you do not agree with our terms, you must not use the Services. The terms ‘we’, ‘us’, or ‘Duende’ refer to Duende Limited.",
					"Our Services evolve constantly and we may need to update these terms from time to time. As such, we reserve the right to change these terms at any time. We will inform you through the Services before the updated terms go into effect. If you do not agree with our updated terms, you must discontinue using the Duende Services."

				"header": "1. Who May Use Our Services",
				"paragraphs": [
					"You may not use the Duende Services, provide any personal information to Duende nor otherwise submit personal information through the Duende Services if you are under the age of 13 unless prior parental permission is given.",
					"You must provide accurate information about yourself to use Duende Services. Creating an account with false information is a violation of our terms.

				"header": "2. Remittances in Our Services",
				"paragraphs": [
					"The remittance feature is designed to send cryptocurrencies to your acquaintances. You may send and receive remittances on the Duende Services for free. You may also send and receive remittances to or from outside the Duende Services, and we do not charge any fees on them either. However, there may be a fee that naturally occurred due to the architecture of the cryptocurrency. We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of cryptocurrencies you can send. The remittance feature cannot be used for the sale of goods or services, nor accepting donations. In these cases, you must use the payment feature of our Services."
				]

			{
				"header": "3. Payments in Our Services",
				"paragraphs": [
					"The payment feature is designed to handle cryptocurrency payments for the sale of goods or services and accepting donations. To accept payments, you have to create a business Duende account. When you accept payments, a certain percentage of the total payment amount will be charged as a fee. A fee may change from time to time. Please refer to FAQ to check the real-time fee. We do not charge any fees for Duende users who make payments. Only business Duende account users who accept payments are charged the fee. You must use the payment feature, not the remittance feature, for the sale of goods or services, and accepting donations."

				"header": "4. Customer Protection Policy in Our Services",
				"paragraphs": [
					"When applicable, Duende’s Customer Protection Policy entitles you to reimbursement for the full purchase price of the item plus the original shipping costs you paid, if any. Duende determines, in its sole discretion, whether your claim qualifies for our Customer Protection Policy. You may be required to return the item to the seller or other party we specify as part of the settlement of your claim. The Customer Protection Policy may apply if you did not receive your item from a seller, or you received an item, but the item is not what you ordered. If the seller presents evidence that they delivered the goods to you, Duende may find in favor of the seller."

				"paragraphs": [
					"Your Duende account may be suspended and we may hold your account balance if your usage turns out to be a breach of our Services. This includes, but is not limited to, the improper usage of the remittance feature in the case you were supposed to use the payment feature instead, and attempts to exploit Duende as a mean of money laundering."
