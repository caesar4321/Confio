# Security Note: Setup Scripts Moved

## What Happened

Some configuration and setup scripts have been moved to a secure location outside this repository.

## Why?

These scripts contained environment-specific configuration that should not be version controlled.

## What Remains

All production code remains in the repository. Only setup and configuration scripts were moved.

## Questions?

Contact the repository maintainer for access to setup documentation.
