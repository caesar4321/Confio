# You're Still in Root Account! Switch to IAM User

## The Problem
You're trying to create access keys for the ROOT account (dangerous!). You need to go to the IAM user "Julian" you just created.

## Solution - Go to Your IAM User

### Option 1: Direct Navigation
1. Go to: **IAM** → **Personas** (Users)
2. Click on the user **"Julian"**
3. Then go to **"Credenciales de seguridad"** tab
4. Create access keys there

### Option 2: Direct Link
Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users/Julian

### Option 3: From Current Page
1. Look at the top of the page - you might see breadcrumbs like:
   ```
   IAM > Security credentials (root)
   ```
2. Click on **"IAM"** to go back
3. Click **"Personas"** in the left menu
4. Click on **"Julian"**

## Visual Guide - Where You Are vs Where You Need to Be

❌ **Where you are now:**
```
Account (root) → Security Credentials → Access Keys
                  ↑ You're here (WRONG place)
```

✅ **Where you need to be:**
```
IAM → Users (Personas) → Julian → Security Credentials → Access Keys
                                   ↑ Need to be here!
```

## Quick Check - How to Know You're in the Right Place

**Wrong place (Root):**
- URL contains: `/account/security-credentials`
- Page title: "Security credentials" 
- Warning about root access keys

**Right place (IAM User):**
- URL contains: `/iam/home#/users/Julian`
- Page title: "Julian" (your IAM user)
- Tabs: Permissions, Groups, Tags, Security credentials

## Step by Step:

1. **Go back to IAM main page**
2. **Click "Personas"** (Users) in left menu
3. **You should see a list with "Julian"**
4. **Click on "Julian"**
5. **Click "Credenciales de seguridad"** tab
6. **NOW create access keys here**

## 🚨 Remember:
- NEVER create access keys for root account
- ALWAYS create them for IAM users
- You already created the user "Julian" - now go to that user's page!
