# Confío Viral Strategy - Revised Approach

## Key Insight from AI Analysis
Based on Duolingo's success data, **official TikTok content drives 62% more downloads** than UGC campaigns. Their "unhinged" mascot videos directly correlate with download spikes, while streak sharing mainly helps retention, not acquisition.

## Our New Strategy

### 1. Simplify Logros (Achievements) - DONE ✅
**Keep only core behaviors:**
- First transaction (4 CONFIO both sides)
- $1 milestone (4 CONFIO)
- Friend referral (4 CONFIO)
- First P2P offer (10 CONFIO)
- Influencer path (100 CONFIO for 10 active referrals)

**Remove:**
- Power trader badges
- Rating achievements
- Complex tier systems
- Image sharing features

### 2. Focus on Official Content
**Julian Moon personal brand:**
- "Korean founder solving LATAM inflation"
- Behind-the-scenes of building in Venezuela
- Real user stories and testimonials
- Humor about banking frustrations

**Content pillars:**
1. **Problem awareness**: Inflation reality checks
2. **Solution demos**: Speed comparisons
3. **Success stories**: Real users saving money
4. **Founder journey**: Building from Korea for LATAM

### 3. UGC as Supporting Role
**What works:**
- Video testimonials (not screenshots)
- "Parent reaction" videos
- Speed test challenges
- Before/after banking comparisons

**What doesn't:**
- Static achievement images
- Repetitive streak posts
- Generic "I earned X CONFIO" shares

2. Localize for each country

4. Measure ROI per content type

## Success Metrics

- **Secondary**: Cost per acquisition
- **Tertiary**: User retention after viral signup

## Budget Allocation
- 70% - Official content creation
- 20% - Influencer partnerships
- 10% - UGC incentives

## Key Takeaway
Stop trying to make users share achievement badges. Instead, create compelling official content that makes people WANT to download the app. Duolingo's success came from Duo the owl being "unhinged," not from users sharing their streak numbers.
