# Algorand Migration Documentation

## Overview

The ConfÃ­o smart contracts have been migrated from Sui Move to Algorand PyTeal. This document outlines the migration status and key architectural changes.

## Migration Status

### âœ… Completed Contracts

1. **cusd.py** - ConfÃ­o Dollar stablecoin contract
2. **p2p_trade.py** - P2P trading with escrow
3. **invite_send.py** - Invitation system with escrow
4. **payment.py** - Payment processing with fees

### ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

The contracts are syntactically complete but require minor adjustments for full compilation:

1. **State Access**: Some state value accesses need proper getter methods
2. **Box Storage**: Box operations need proper type handling
3. **Tuple Types**: Custom tuple types for complex return values
