## Key Features

### Sponsor Pattern
All production contracts implement the sponsor pattern where:
- Platform (sponsor) funds all Minimum Balance Requirements (MBR)
- Users only need stablecoins, never ALGO
- 100% MBR recovery through proper box management

### Production Contracts
Production-ready contracts include:
- Sponsor funding for all MBR
- Explicit MBR refunds after box deletion
- Recipient opt-in checks
- Proper order of operations (delete → refund)

## Quick Start

### Deploy All Production Contracts
```bash
cd p2p_trade/deploy
python deploy_production_contracts.py
```

### Create Tokens
```bash
# Create CONFIO token (ASA)
cd confio
python create_confio_token_algorand.py

```

                                    ├── cUSD (USDC/T-Bill backed stablecoin)
                                    ├── CONFIO (1B fixed utility token)
                                    ├── P2P Vault (escrow)
                                    ├── Payment Router
                                    └── Inbox Router (invites)
```

### Token Economics
- **CONFIO**: 1,000,000,000 fixed supply utility/governance token (no backing)
- **cUSD**: 1:1 backed stablecoin (USDC deposits or T-Bill reserves)
- **No cross-collateralization**: CONFIO and cUSD are independent

## Security Features

- **Box Storage**: Temporary, recoverable storage for trades/invites
- **Sponsor Pattern**: Platform covers all blockchain fees
- **Opt-in Checks**: Verify recipients can receive tokens
- **Dispute Resolution**: Arbitration for P2P trades
- **Time Limits**: Auto-expiry for trades (15 min) and invites (7 days)

## Testing

Each module contains its own test suite:
```bash
# Test cUSD
cd cusd/tests
python test_simple_mint.py

# Test P2P trades
cd p2p_trade/tests
python test_production_contracts.py
```
