# Sui Coin Management Strategy

## Overview

On Sui blockchain, tokens are represented as individual `Coin<T>` objects rather than account balances. This creates unique challenges and opportunities for wallet applications.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Coin Fragmentation
- Each payment creates a new coin object
- Users accumulate multiple coin objects over time
- Example: Receiving 5 payments of 1 USDC = 5 separate coin objects

### 2. Transaction Limits
- Sui limits the number of objects per transaction (typically 512)
- Gas optimization requires careful coin selection
- Large numbers of small coins increase transaction costs

## Current Implementation

### Balance Display
- **Method**: `suix_getBalance` RPC call
- **Behavior**: Automatically aggregates all coin objects
- **User Experience**: Users see total balance, not individual coins

### Balance Caching
- Database stores aggregated balances
- Redis caches for performance
- Blockchain verification on-demand

## Recommended Strategy

### 1. Automatic Coin Management

```python
# Thresholds
MAX_COINS_PER_TYPE = 10  # Merge if more than this
MIN_COINS_KEEP = 3       # Keep some unmerged for gas/parallel txs
```

### 2. Smart Coin Selection

When sending tokens:
1. **Exact match**: Use single coin if amount matches
2. **Minimal coins**: Select fewest coins to cover amount
3. **Gas optimization**: Reserve some coins for gas payment

### 3. Periodic Optimization

Run daily background task to:
- Merge excessive fragmentation
- Maintain optimal coin distribution
- Log statistics for monitoring

### 4. User Experience

**Transparent to users**:
- Show total balance only
- Handle merging automatically
- No manual coin management needed

**Advanced users** (future feature):
- Optional "Coin Manager" view
- Manual merge/split controls
- Gas optimization insights

## Implementation Strategy: Lazy Merging

### Core Philosophy
- **Only merge when necessary**: Don't optimize prematurely
- **Gas costs scale**: Merging 100 coins costs ~50x more than merging 2
- **Keep some coins unmerged**: Enables parallel transactions and gas payments

### When to Merge
1. **Transaction needs >10 coins**: Merge to reduce complexity
2. **Excessive fragmentation (>20 coins)**: Consider background optimization
3. **User-initiated**: Explicit request for optimization

### When NOT to Merge
1. **Few coins (<10)**: Gas cost not worth it
2. **Regular operations**: Let coins accumulate naturally
3. **Preemptive optimization**: Wastes gas for uncertain benefit

## Technical Considerations

### 1. zkLogin Integration
- Coin operations need user signatures
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Consider transaction sponsorship

### 2. Performance
- Cache coin object lists
- Minimize RPC calls
- Background processing for merges

### 3. Error Handling
- Insufficient balance across coins
- Failed merge transactions
- Coin object version conflicts

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User receives many small payments
- **Problem**: 50 coins of 0.1 CUSD each
- **Solution**: Auto-merge into 5 coins of 1 CUSD
- **Result**: Lower transaction costs, better UX

### Scenario 2: User wants to send exact amount
- **Problem**: Need 5.5 CUSD, have coins of 3, 2, 1, 0.5
- **Solution**: Select 3 + 2 + 1 coins, split 0.5 from change
- **Result**: Exact payment without manual management

### Scenario 3: Gas optimization
- **Problem**: All coins are large denominations
- **Solution**: Keep 2-3 smaller coins for gas
- **Result**: Smooth transactions without gas issues

## Monitoring and Metrics

Track:
- Average coins per user per token type
- Merge transaction frequency
- Gas costs saved through optimization
- User transaction success rates

## Security Considerations

1. **Signature Management**: Secure handling of zkLogin for merges
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent excessive merge operations
3. **Audit Trail**: Log all coin operations
4. **Error Recovery**: Handle partial merge failures

## Future Enhancements

1. **Predictive Merging**: ML-based optimization
2. **Cross-token Swaps**: Integrated with coin management
3. **Batch Operations**: Multiple payments in one transaction
4. **Gas Sponsorship**: For coin optimization transactions
