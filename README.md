# Confío: LATAM's Open Wallet for the Dollar Economy

**Confío** is an open-source Web3 wallet and transaction platform designed for Latin America.  
It enables users to **send, receive, and hold stablecoins** (cUSD (Confío Dollar)) on the **Algorand blockchain**, with zero gas fees and no crypto complexity.

Built for real people — not just crypto experts.

## 🌎 Why Confío?

In countries like Venezuela, Argentina, and beyond, inflation erodes trust in local currencies.  
Confío helps people access stable dollars, send remittances, and pay each other — simply and safely — using blockchain.

> "Confío" means **"I trust"** in Spanish.  
> We open-source everything because **trust must be earned, not assumed**.
